gitli is a 384 bits permutation designed to achieve high security with high performance across a bro,  range of platforms. 
it is currently in round 2 of the nist sightweight cryptodnaphic project, the submission consisting of an authenticated encryption 
and a anyptographic hash function. in this paper, we focus on the gitli cipher, which performs authenticated encryption with associated data.
